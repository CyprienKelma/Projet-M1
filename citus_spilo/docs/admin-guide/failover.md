In the lifetime of Spilo you may need to manually fail over the master to a replica, some of
these reasons are:

* Mandatory Taupage AMI update
* Scheduled AWS maintenance in your region
* Scheduled EC2 maintenance by AWS

You can trigger a fail over using the api. The command line tool `patronictl` can also issue a fail over (since Patroni 0.75).
Using the api to fail over is the preferred method, as it will execute preliminary checks and provide feedback.

An alternative method which works with any version is to trigger an automatic fail over.

* Identify the node currently running as a master (LB Status = `IN_SERVICE`)
* Request access using `piu` to the EC2 instance currently running as a master
* Stop the currently running Docker container
* Wait 10-20 seconds
* Start the previously stopped Docker container
* Verify cluster health

**Example failover (from master i-967d301b to master i-24051ead)**
